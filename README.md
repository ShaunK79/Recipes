# Recipes
A simple webpage of html and css for some of my favourite recipes.

So again, to practice what i have learnt i created a recipe webpage where i made use of <ul>, <ol> and <li>.
The recipes - image, ingredients and method each have their own html and css files which were linked to the main recipesIndex.html page. I also created a <button> with an anchor tag as 'Main Page', top and bottom, to click on when you wanted to return back to the main page.

I learnt alot about <ul>, <ol>, <li>, links - stylesheets, recipes, buttons.
